                    This project explores the growth trends of remote workers and digital nomads from 2019 to 2024,
                    analyzing how each group has evolved over time. As technology advances and work flexibility
                    increases, more people have embraced remote work, with some choosing a stable home base while others
                    adopt a location-independent lifestyle as digital nomads. By comparing the number of remote workers
                    to digital nomads over the years, this project highlights key trends and insights into the changing
                    nature of work.

                    Digital nomads choose to combine working remotely and traveling for various reasons and lengths of
                    time. This may be for years or shorter “workcations” lasting from weeks to months. Some travel the
                    globe, but many never cross borders, choosing to live and work in a single country or city. They are
                    united by their passion for travel, desire for adventure, and interest in new cultures. While the
                    rate of increase for digital nomads has leveled from its pandemic-induced skyrocketing during 2020
                    and 2021, the total number of digital nomads has still grown more than 147% since 2019, now reaching
                    11% of the U.S. workforce overall.

                        From 2019 to 2024, the number of remote workers consistently remained higher than the
                        number of digital nomads. Remote workers saw significant growth from 3.2 million in
                        2019 to a peak of 11.1 million in 2022 before slightly declining to 10.2 million in
                        2024. In contrast, digital nomads experienced steady but slower growth, increasing
                        from 4.1 million in 2019 to 7.9 million in 2024. While both groups expanded over the
                        years, remote workers outnumbered digital nomads throughout the period, showing a
                        more substantial initial rise and stabilization in later years.

                        Consistent with prior year study results, younger generations, Gen Z (26%)
                        and Millennials (38%), continue to comprise most digital nomads (64%).
                        The rapid increase in Gen Z digital nomads (born 1997-2012) is the primary
                        driver. In 2019, the oldest Gen Zers were just 22, and very few were digital
                        nomads. In fact, Gen Z’s 2019 share of digital nomads was less than 1%.
                        But over the past five years, Gen Z has aged into the workforce and proven
                        to be an active travel generation. Because of this, in 2024 about one in four
                        digital nomads are Gen Zers. We expect Gen Z’s share of digital nomads
                        to continue to increase. Gen Z is still aging into the workforce, and as they
                        age, they will have more income and greater work opportunities to become
                        digital nomads. Older cohorts’— Gen Xers (born 1965-1980) and Baby Boomers (born 1946-
                        1964)— share decreased in 2024. The main reason for the decline is that
                        aging Baby Boomers are leaving the workforce, and while many are still
                        traveling, not working while traveling means they no longer meet our digital
                        nomad definition.

                    Full-Time vs. Part-Time Employment: Because digital nomads are a mix of full-timers (64%) and
                    part-timers (36%), and many only
                    do it for
                    part of a year, their income varies widely. Although digital nomads report high satisfaction levels,
                    being nomadic is not without challenges.

                    reporting having an advanced degree (versus 13% for adult Americans).

                    The top challenges reported by current digital nomads
                    are financial stress (27%), being away from family and friends (26%), personal
                    safety (24%), time zone differences making work difficult (23%), and travel
                    burnout (21%). These challenges are consistent with prior years. However, the
                    share of digital nomads reporting these challenges has declined since 2020,
                    primarily due to the loosening of the pandemic and pandemic restrictions.

                    In conclusion, explored how remote workers consistently outnumbered digital nomads, with remote
                    work seeing rapid growth before stabilizing, while digital nomadism experienced steady but slower
                    increases. Additionally, the age distribution of digital nomads, revealing that younger
                    professionals and mid-career workers make up the majority of this group. The breakdown of full-time
                    versus part-time digital nomads showed that while many embrace this lifestyle full-time, a
                    significant portion balances it with part-time or freelance work.

                    The education levels within the digital nomad community, noting that most individuals
                    hold at least a bachelor's degree, often in fields that support remote work. Common challenges faced
                    by digital nomads include being away from family, financial stress, and time zone issues. The most
                    popular industries among digital nomads, with technology, marketing, consulting,
                    and creative fields being the most prominent.

                    Overall, this project highlights the evolving nature of work and the increasing flexibility that
                    allows professionals to work remotely, whether from a fixed location or while traveling the world as
                    digital nomads.
